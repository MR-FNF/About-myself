👋 Hi, I’m @Aubrey

👀 I’m interested on making Friday Night Funkin' mods with PsychEngine!

🌱 I’m currently learning at school (online cuz Corona), cuz when I started this profile, I am almost 11 years old!

👦 I'm actually 11 years old now!

💖 I really like Friday Night Funkin' Psych engine mod!

💻 I am a young coder!

📃 I am a lua coder on Psych Engine and I am not good at it!

🍉 I am working on a mod call 'Strange Night Funkin' mod'.

🍉 Strange Fruits Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/Strange%20Fruits

🚀 My dream is become a coder!

😕 My gender? Well... that is a secret! Why my name contain 'MR'? Well... because the boy play Friday Night Funkin' more than the girl, but I play it a lot!

😱 I really scare about ghost.

💑 Please don't say something bad to me!
